# DSP-bandpass-FIR-filter

Abstract

Filter design is very important in many areas But is especially indispensable in electronics. Filters are used in many areas, from voice recognition, communication, image processing to deep learning algorithms. In this project, many filters have been designed by using Matlab program and made ready for use. In this project, FIR bandpass filters have been emphasized.


Digital Signal Processing Hardware Lecture (eem478) Final Project

The aim of this project is to teach the student the filter design and the usage area of the filter. FIR filter and bandpass filters are used in the project. FIR filter design is used with window method. More detailed information will be given in the following stages.
During the project, Matlab R2018b program and Windows 10 x64 1089 operating system were used as development environment.
